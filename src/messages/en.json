          "a": "Myopic regression can rarely occur in high myopia patients. However, Healing Eye Clinic's 'SMILE PRO' dramatically reduces the probability of regression due to minimal corneal tissue removal and superior structural stability. If vision does decline, re-correction may be possible depending on residual corneal thickness, and our lifetime care program provides continuous monitoring and care.",

        {
          "q": "Can I get presbyopia surgery even without cataracts?",
          "a": "Yes, it's possible. If the crystalline lens has lost its accommodative power and near vision is uncomfortable, you can correct it through 'presbyopia-correcting lens implantation' or 'monovision LASIK.' However, if you're in your late 40s to early 50s, it's advisable to consider the possibility of future cataract development and consult thoroughly with your doctor about the optimal timing for surgery.",

        {
          "q": "I have severe dry eye syndrome. Can I still get vision correction surgery?",
          "a": "For patients with severe dry eye syndrome, we recommend 'SMILE LASIK,' which causes less corneal surface damage than standard LASIK, or 'ICL lens implantation.' By first improving dry eye with 'IPL laser' treatment before surgery, combined with an intensive post-operative care program, you can restore healthy vision.",

              "q": "It's been 7 days since surgery and my vision is still blurry. Is this normal?",
              "a": "Blurry vision after surgery is mostly a temporary phenomenon caused by corneal swelling. While there are individual differences, it can take about a month for corneal swelling to completely subside. Therefore, the blurriness you are currently experiencing is part of the recovery process and there is no need to worry. Your vision will gradually become clearer over time, and you will be able to see much better after one month."

              "q": "There are white particles floating in my autologous serum eye drops. Is this okay?",
              "a": "Yes, white particles floating in autologous serum eye drops is a normal phenomenon. Autologous serum eye drops contain components from our body that form blood clots, so clots may appear as lumps that look like white floating particles."
            },
            {
              "q": "How long should I use autologous serum eye drops?",
              "a": "Serum eye drops are used not only for faster recovery but also as a treatment for dry eye syndrome, and you should use them until they are completely finished. If you would like additional prescriptions, please contact the clinic."
            },
            {
              "q": "My vision is blurry after surgery. When will it return to normal?",
              "a": "Blurry vision after surgery is a normal phenomenon caused by corneal edema. Generally, the edema decreases after 1-2 weeks and vision gradually improves."
            },
            {
              "q": "My near vision is still not fully recovered. When will it improve?",
              "a": "It takes about 2 weeks of adaptation for near vision to fully recover after surgery. During this period, near vision gradually improves as your eyes adapt to the post-surgical changes."

              "a": "Stinging and pain after LASIK surgery is a normal phenomenon. Generally, you may experience excessive tearing and stinging for 6 hours after surgery, and the symptoms gradually subside after 1-2 days. Please be careful not to rub your eyes."
            },
            {
              "q": "When I got home after LASIK surgery, I noticed the protective lens had fallen out. What should I do?",
              "a": "If the protective lens falls out after LASIK surgery, there is no need to worry. In LASIK surgery, the protective lens is mainly inserted to relieve pain and prevent eye dryness, and it does not significantly affect vision recovery."

              "q": "After surgery, I need to work while looking at a monitor, but severe light glare is making it difficult. What should I do?",
              "a": "Light glare after LASIK surgery is a normal phenomenon. The period for vision to stabilize is about 1 month, and near vision recovers the slowest among all distances. Therefore, you may experience severe light glare for about 1 month after surgery."
            },
            {
              "q": "Is UV protection still necessary after LASIK surgery?",
              "a": "The importance of UV protection has become somewhat less critical compared to the past. Particularly with LASIK surgery where the flap is covered, the corneal epithelium recovers quickly and provides high UV protection, so UV protection is not necessarily required."
            },
            {
              "q": "My vision is blurry after LASIK surgery. When will it return to normal?",

              "q": "Why is my vision blurry when I wake up in the morning after LASIK surgery, but gets better as time passes?",
              "a": "Blurry vision in the morning after LASIK surgery is likely due to dry eye syndrome. During the corneal epithelium recovery process after surgery, tear production decreases and dry eye syndrome can occur, which can be most severe in the morning."
            },
            {
              "q": "Can I freely use computers and smartphones from the day after LASIK surgery?",
              "a": "You can use computers and smartphones in your daily life from the day after LASIK surgery. However, you should take breaks in between to avoid straining your eyes and apply artificial tears to prevent dryness."

              "a": "Pain is most severe 2-3 days after LASEK surgery and begins to gradually subside from the 4th day. However, the duration of pain can vary depending on individual health conditions, surgical method, and recovery speed."
            },
            {
              "q": "It's the 4th day after LASEK surgery and my vision is worse than right after surgery. I'm worried.",
              "a": "Reduced vision on the 4th day after LASEK surgery is a temporary phenomenon caused by the corneal epithelium recovery process. Between 3-7 days after surgery, vision can appear blurry as the corneal epithelium gathers toward the center."
            },
            {
              "q": "It's been a month after LASEK surgery and my vision is still blurry. What could be the reason?",
              "a": "The time it takes for vision to fully stabilize after LASEK surgery varies by individual, and generally takes up to 3 months. In cases of high myopia or high astigmatism, the vision recovery period can be longer and may last up to 6 months."
            },
            {
              "q": "When should I start using Fluorometholone eye drops after LASEK surgery? How many times a day should I use them, and for how long?",
              "a": "Fluorometholone eye drops should be used immediately after removing the lens following LASEK surgery. Apply one drop 4 times a day: morning, lunch, evening, and before bed. The eye drops should be used for approximately 3 months, though the duration may vary according to your ophthalmologist's instructions."

              "q": "When can I start night driving after LASEK surgery? Right now, driving is difficult due to glare.",
              "a": "Night driving after LASEK surgery varies by individual, but is generally possible after 1-3 months. In the beginning, it is advisable to avoid night driving due to light glare. We recommend starting with daytime driving and gradually adapting, then attempting night driving after 1-3 months."

              "q": "It's been about 6 months after ICL surgery. Do I still need regular check-ups?",
              "a": "Yes, regular check-ups are essential even 6 months after ICL surgery. Since a lens is implanted inside the eye, corneal endothelial cell count may decrease, and regular check-ups are necessary to check the endothelial cell count and determine if there is any decrease."
            },

              "q": "Is it okay to sleep face down after ICL surgery?",
              "a": "It is advisable to avoid sleeping face down for at least one month after ICL surgery. Sleeping face down can cause increased intraocular pressure, which may adversely affect recovery after ICL surgery."
            },
            {
              "q": "How long should I wear the eye shield?",
              "a": "If you accidentally rub your eyes while sleeping, it can interfere with the lens settling in your eye, and to prevent damage to the surgical site, we generally recommend wearing an eye shield for about 2 weeks."

            {
              "q": "Can cataract surgery recur?",
              "a": "The cataract surgery itself has a very low recurrence rate. However, there is a concept called posterior capsule opacification. Posterior capsule opacification refers to the formation of a membrane on the remaining posterior capsule after surgery, and it can be easily removed with laser treatment."
